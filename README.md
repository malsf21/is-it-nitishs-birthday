# Is it Nitish's Birthday
#### Dedicated to Nitish Dhingra

Heyo, this is a tiny little web-app that tells you whether or not it's Nitish's Birthday! In addition, you can make your own is it ___'s Birthday.

# Setup

Want to replicate your own version! Coolio! First, clone a local copy of this repo to your local machine.

Then, you need to replace a few things: in the `checkBirthday(name,month,day)`, you need to change the info so everything matches up what you want. `name` is a String, while `month` and `day` are numbers from 1-12 and 0-31 respectively.

In addition, the two images I use are `ohyes.png` and `ohno.png`, in the `resources` directory. You'll also find `september.mp3`, the song I used in the successful page.

Happy Birthday Nitish!
